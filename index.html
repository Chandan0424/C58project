            because you don't need to put that much effort only workout your mind and use your fingers
            <br>
            but it is one thing i am sure every one likes
            <br>
            but only the smart and the experienced excel.
            <br>
            The pro ones can join esports meaning a contest or championship
            <br>
            for each game (not all games) in which you will get money or not
            <br>
            based on your rank in the leaderboard or you just have to
            <br>
            to get the money.
